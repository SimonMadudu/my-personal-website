            This is where it all starts.

             I am beginning my journey as a web developer. I don't know whether I'll be doing this or electrical or something else in the future. All I know now is in some months, I'll know how to decorate a website nicely.

            As of 8/19/2025 at 12:06PM, I do not know how to implement css in any other way other than by using the style attribute in the opening tag of different elements. In a few hours, this will surely change. I am excited to see how much knowledge I can amass in this relatively short span of time.

            I am determined to rapidly expand my coding knowledge so I can become self-sufficient in the near future. I have lived enough years off of the hard work of another person; it's my time to step up and ultimately return the favor.

        <p style="margin: 0px 20px 520px 0px;">
            Below will be where I will be doing the coding for what I'm learning.
